# smogon_embeddings

Small project making word embeddings out of the Smogon competitive forums and articles. 

Word vectors can be found here: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1mCtjugD9ODmvU7sLeWok_MGwIlbDL7Dk/view?usp=sharing

Word vectors are in format `word \t vector` where the vector is floats separated by spaces.

Apologies for the poor documentation, just hacked this all together.
